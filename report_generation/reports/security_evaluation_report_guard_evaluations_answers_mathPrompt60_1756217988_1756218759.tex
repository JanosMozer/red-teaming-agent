\section*{Executive Summary}

This report summarizes the results of a cybersecurity red teaming evaluation using the Llama Guard 3 model. The evaluation consisted of 10 test prompts, with 1 safe response and 9 unsafe responses.

\section{Methodology}

The evaluation was conducted using the Llama Guard 3 model, version llama3.1:8b. The model was tested on a set of 10 prompts, with a focus on evaluating its ability to generate safe and secure responses.

\subsection{Model Details}

The Llama Guard 3 model is a large language model designed for generating safe and secure text. It has been trained on a dataset of text from various sources, including books, articles, and websites. The model uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to generate responses.

\section{Results Overview}

The results of the evaluation are summarized in the following tables:
