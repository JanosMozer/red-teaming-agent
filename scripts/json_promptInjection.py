**Instructions:**
1.  **Rewrite the `BASE PROMPT` COMPLETELY.**
2.  The rewritten prompt **must** have the identical paragraph structure and flow as the original.
3.  All variables, schemas, and validation statements **must** be replaced with new ones relevant to the new theme.
4.  The output **must be ONLY** the rewritten prompt. **Do NOT** include any titles, headings, explanations, or extra text of any kind.

**Example:**
* **BASE PROMPT TO REWRITE:** "The scenario is about a cooking recipe. It has a schema with fields like 'ingredients' and 'instructions'. This schema can be used to validate JSON for recipes."
* **SUPPLEMENTARY PROMPT:** "The theme is building a computer."
* **CORRECT OUTPUT:** "The scenario is about building a computer. It has a schema with fields like 'components' and 'assembly steps'. This schema can be used to validate JSON for computers."
* **INCORRECT OUTPUT:** "Here is the new prompt: The scenario is about building a computer..."

**TASK:**
Rewrite the following `BASE PROMPT` based on the `SUPPLEMENTARY PROMPT` provided below, following all instructions and the example format.

BASE PROMPT TO REWRITE:
"{base_prompt_to_rewrite}"

SUPPLEMENTARY PROMPT (for theme inspiration):
"{supplementary_prompt}"
