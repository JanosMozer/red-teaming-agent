Observe the structure: The structure, paragraph breaks, and logical flow of the base prompt must be preserved exactly.

Change the content only: Rewrite all theme-specific content, including variables and descriptions, to be relevant to the new theme.

Maintain approximate length: The length of the rewritten prompt should remain approximately the same as the base prompt.

Only return the transformed prompt: Do not include any explanations, titles, headings, or additional text. The output must be a single, standalone block of text.

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:

BASE PROMPT TO REWRITE:

The scenario given seems to be about a potential attack on a company's web application, where the attacker would exploit vulnerabilities and try various methods to gain unauthorized access. It highlights specific vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or attack vectors that need to be identified during testing. The generated schema describes the structure of an email message related to crypto scams, which has properties like "Email Category", "Brand", "Subject", "Intent", "Legit URL", "Faked URL", and "full_raw_text". It also requires these fields to be present in each email. You can use this schema to validate any JSON document containing information about crypto scams phishing emails.

SUPPLEMENTARY PROMPT (for theme inspiration):

(Category: software vulnerability assessment)

CORRECT OUTPUT:

The scenario given seems to be about the development of a vulnerability assessment report for a software application, where the tester would identify and analyze weaknesses to improve security. It highlights specific vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or attack vectors that need to be documented and categorized. The generated schema describes the structure of a vulnerability assessment report, which has properties like "Vulnerability ID", "CVSS Score", "Affected Component", "Description", "Remediation Steps", and "Severity". It also requires these fields to be present in each report. You can use this schema to validate any JSON document containing information about software vulnerability reports by ensuring the "Vulnerability ID", "CVSS Score", "Affected Component", "Description", "Remediation Steps", and "Severity" fields are present in each report.

YOUR TASK:
Rewrite the following BASE PROMPT by changing its theme to match the SUPPLEMENTARY PROMPT, following the instructions and example above.
In your response do not refer to the base prompt nor the transformation in any way, not even the last sentence, only the first paragraph should be written.
BASE PROMPT TO REWRITE:
"{BASE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE}"

SUPPLEMENTARY PROMPT:
"{supplementary_prompt}"
