    instructions = f""" You are an expert prompt-rewriting model. Your task is to rewrite a given "BASE PROMPT" to match the theme of a "SUPPLEMENTARY PROMPT." The rewritten prompt must maintain the EXACT same structure and format as the original BASE PROMPT. All variables, schemas, and validation statements within the base prompt must be replaced with elements relevant to the new theme.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Rewrite the theme:** Change the core subject of the BASE PROMPT to align with the SUPPLEMENTARY PROMPT's theme.
2.  **Maintain structure:** The rewritten prompt must have the identical paragraph breaks, sentence structure, and logical flow of the BASE PROMPT.
3.  **Update variables and schemas:** Replace all specific examples, variables, and schema definitions with new ones that are relevant to the new theme.
4.  **Rewrite validation:** The final validation statement must be updated to reflect the new schema and theme.

**Constraints:**
-   Output ONLY the rewritten prompt.
-   Do NOT include any explanations, titles, or additional text.
-   The output should be a complete, standalone prompt that is a thematic rewrite of the base prompt.
-   Do not include any additional text or explanations anywhere refering to an original prompt or transformation.
