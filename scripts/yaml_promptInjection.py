TRANSFORMATION GUIDELINES:
1. Preserve the exact structure, paragraph breaks, and logical flow
2. Change only the theme-specific content (scenarios, variables, descriptions)
3. Maintain approximately the same length
4. Output only the transformed prompt - no explanations or additional text

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:

ORIGINAL BASE PROMPT:
{BASE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE}

THEME INSPIRATION: {supplementary_prompt}

TRANSFORMED OUTPUT:
{EXAMPLE_TRANSFORMED_OUTPUT}

YOUR TASK:
Using the example transformation above as your guide, transform the following BASE PROMPT to match the SUPPLEMENTARY PROMPT theme. Follow the same transformation approach shown in the example. Do not make stuff up, only write what is relevant to the theme.

BASE PROMPT TO TRANSFORM:
